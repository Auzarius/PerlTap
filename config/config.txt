**** CC Finder Filters for Report ****
Instructions: Seperate values with commas and no spaces like so: NSY,IW,STOL,DSL
"RCODE  : NSY,IW,STOL,DSL"
You can also do the same for the status as such: TESTBOARD,PENDING,HOLD TESTBOARD,ALLOCATED
"STATUS : TESTBOARD,PENDING,HOLD TESTBOARD,ALLOCATED"
If you put a space or any other character before, after or inside of a word, it will be used as if
if was another later in the word with no bias.  In some cases this could cause mismatch and yield
undesired results.  If you set the Report Code filter to PHONE it will pull just phone report codes, if
you set to it ALL it will pull all report codes, and if you set it to DSL it will pull all DSL report codes.
Setting RCODE to SCRUB will have it pull NDT,CCO,CBC,BDR,DSLCC,DSLDL.  Further suggestions are appreciated.
